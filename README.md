# U.S. College Undergraduate Enrollment Analysis (2016–2022)

## Overview

This project investigates trends in undergraduate enrollment across U.S. colleges from 2016 to 2022, with a focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession. The analysis uses data from multiple years, cleans and merges it, and applies statistical and visual methods to uncover patterns and state-level differences.

## Repository Contents

- **Project Work.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook containing data cleaning, merging, analysis, and visualization.
- **cleaned_data.csv**: Final cleaned dataset used for analysis.
- **ssrn-5222094.pdf**: Published version of the research paper.
- **Reserach Paper.pdf**: Full research paper draft.
- **Proposal.pdf**: Project proposal outlining objectives and methodology.

## Research Questions

- How did undergraduate enrollment in U.S. colleges change from 2016 to 2022?
- What was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession on enrollment trends?
- Are there significant differences in enrollment changes across states?

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Enrollment data from 2016–2022, merged from annual CSV files.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of missing, duplicate, and non-U.S. records; standardization of columns.
- **Analysis**: 
  - Descriptive statistics and visualizations (boxplots, histograms, heatmaps).
  - Comparison of pre-COVID (2016–2019), COVID/recession (2020–2021), and post-COVID (2022) periods.
  - State-level analysis of enrollment changes.
  - Regression analysis to identify significant predictors of enrollment.

## Key Findings

- Overall undergraduate enrollment trends show [insert summary: e.g., decline, recovery, or stability].
- The COVID-19 pandemic and recession had [insert effect: e.g., a significant negative/positive impact] on enrollment.
- Some states experienced larger changes than others, with [insert notable states] showing the highest increases/decreases.
- Regression analysis indicates that [insert key predictors, e.g., year, activity type] are significant factors.
